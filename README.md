# switching_btw_machines
In this problem there are two machines 'A' and 'B',the aim here is to switch between machines 'A' and 'B' every minute if necessary so that 
maximum amount of work can be completed.If in a minute 'i-1' work is done by machine 'A' and you wish to change it to machine 'B' in 'i+1'th
minute ,then the work done in 'i'th minute is zero, it continues in similar fashion for machine 'B' also.
